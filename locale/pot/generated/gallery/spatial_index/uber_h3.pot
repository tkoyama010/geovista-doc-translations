msgid "A spatial index is a structured collection of shapes that allows you to approximately describe any region by simply taking a subset of shapes from that index. The ``H3`` library, developed by Uber as an open source project, uses hexagons to divide up the earth into cells. ``H3`` is hierarchical, meaning that there are multiple resolutions of hexagonal meshes dividing the earth. Depending on the resolution, these hexagonal cells range from **~1m^2** to **~4,000,000km^2**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../geovista/docs/src/generated/gallery/spatial_index/uber_h3.rst:36
msgid "The coarsest mesh in ``H3``, the **base resolution mesh**, consists of **110 hexagons** and **12 pentagons**, this is the starting point in a hierarchical sequence of hexagonal meshes. Its structure is built on top of a **base icosahedron**, the relationship between the **base icosahedron** and the **base resolution mesh** informs the structure of the meshes of the further meshes in the sequence. Note that, a spherical surface cannot be tessellated solely with hexagons; pentagons are also required."

#: ../../geovista/docs/src/generated/gallery/spatial_index/uber_h3.rst:45
msgid "The **12 vertices** of the underlying **base icosahedron** anchor the center of the **12 pentagon cells**, around which the **110 hexagon cells** are tessellated to form a fixed base mesh. Note that the center of all pentagons are located over ocean, which suits the business model of Uber. Incidentally, these are the locations of most projection distortion."

msgid "``H3`` is a hierarchical geospatial index. Each cell has a unique 64-bit ``H3Index`` that identifies its geospatial location and position in the ``H3`` hierarchy. Every parent hexagonal cell is subdivided into **7 child hexagonal cells**, and every parent pentagon cell is subdivided into **6 child cells**, precisely one of which is a pentagon."
